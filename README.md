# Create FAQ

Angular application to create the FAQ Item with intent of the SAM Design System and supports the SAM.gov ecosystem.

# Design 
Due to time constraints we could not able to implement certain features we intend to do.

 1. Implemented New FAQ page using Formly components.
 2. Implemented workspace to show all faq items using mock data and service using sds components framework
 3. We do not have time to implement the filters and autocomplete features.
 
# Build
 
 Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
